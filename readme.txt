WP-Invoice lets you send invoices to your clients using WordPress.

== Description ==

WP-Invoice lets WordPress blog owners send itemized invoices to their clients. Ideal for web developers, SEO consultants, general contractors, or anyone with a WordPress blog and clients to bill. The plugin ties into WP's user management database to keep track of your clients and their information.
Once an invoice is created from the WP admin section, an email with a brief description and a unique link is sent to client. Clients follow the link to your blog's special invoice page, view their invoice, and pay their bill using PayPal. The control panel is very user-friendly and intuitive. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Create a page or post you plan to use to show all your invoices, (i.e. "http://yourblog.com/WebInvoice"). 
2. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
3. Open the plugin configuration page, which is located under Web Invoice -> Settings  enter in your information.  In the very least you need to specify the "Page to Display Invoices", and "PayPal Address".
4. To create your first invoice navigate to Web Invoice -> New Invoice, and select the user who will be the recipient. (You may need to create a profile for your client first, they never have to log in, this is simply for tracking purposes)
